=======

A naive pure-Ruby implementation of the Simplex algorithm for solving linear programming problems. Solves maximizations in standard form.

### Why?

I wrote this because I needed to solve some small allocation problems for a web game I'm writing, 
and there didn't seem to be any Ruby 2.0 bindings for the "pro" solver libraries, 
and anyway they are hard to install on Heroku.

 * *Use it for*: small LP problems, when you have trouble loading native or Java solvers,
     and when you can accept not that great performance. 
 * *Don't use it for*: large LP problems, when you have access to native solvers, when you need very fast solving time.

### Usage

To solve the linear programming problem:

    max x +  y

      2x +  y <= 4
       x + 2y <= 3

       x, y >= 0

Like this:

    result = Simplex.new(
      [1, 1],       # coefficients of objective function
      [             # matrix of inequality coefficients on the lhs ...
        [ 2,  1],
        [ 1,  2],
      ],
      [4, 3]        # .. and the rhs of the inequalities
    ).solution
    # => [(5/3), (2/3)]
